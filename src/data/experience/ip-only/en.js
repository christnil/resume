Before the project started different parts of the company worked mostly in their own defined processes and tool. The tools could be bought systems but mostly excel and email was used to handle sales and deliveries. The aim was to to document all core processes through the different parts of the company and set up integrations and build new systems to make work faster, easier and less error prone.';

    description: 'I started the project as a backend .Net developer working with business sales support. IP-Only had just merged with another company called DGC and had inherited some .Net systems for searching connectivity options for addresses and some tools used for deliveries in the Network acquired from DGC. The main issues with this project was that these systems where in bad shape and lacked documentation. Quickly after starting the project I lifted the issue and proposed building new requirements in the IP-Only stack and develop a new module in the legacy system to benefit from everything done in the IP-Only tech stack. This finally led to so much of the functions used being in the IP-Only stack that we decided to build the UI and missing logic there as well and deprecate the old system. The value gained from this was a more reliable system and also the entire IT development department has the competence needed to fix bugs and monitor the system instead of having a single person responsible for all of this.',

    description: 'As the project progressed the role became more and more a Java/AngularJS fullstack developer continuing to build a customer portal where enterprise customers could log in by themself and search for network options for their locations. This new customer facing feature was built upon the engine for search described in the previous role. And had a angular frontend for managing addresses, products and so on. This system was integrated with a new self developed product catalog and a back-office ui to manage all products. This led to a faster way for customers to get quotes, often automatic replies, on buying new products.',
