    description: 'I was originally intended to be a back-end .Net developer bu I was put in a team that had just built a Node.JS API with a AngularJS front-end. Before starting their next project I was tasked with comparing the new angular version and ReactJS. To do this I tried building a small application in both frameworks and talking to my Netlight colleges at SVT who had used React for a while. I proposed to switch to React which we did and it worked out great. I still feel that I like working in React better than Angular even with the newer versions. We then continued to build smaller services for their webpage using Node/Express API:s and React front-end apps.'

    description: 'When we had started to build more of the React applications for our web. We started to notice the need for a component library and common styles to use in our applications. I started pushing for us taking after e.g. Airbnb and make a style guide with components that can be reused and to publish all of these both as a npm package and as a webpage with examples and code snippets. Me and a college decided to boot strap this with a workshop for all teams working on the web. We set up a basic repository, had a short introduction, divided up groups with people from different teams and assigned them with building one component each and also an example page where they could be used. They then spread out and started working from their own ideas and we as workshop leaders moved around to each groups and checked if anyone needed help pr input from us. The package was well received in all teams and all was included in an early stage in creating the package and components. It was important to us that all web developers where comfortable making changes and adding new components in the library since it would otherwise become more of an obstacle than a helpful tool. When I left thomas cook this project was still going strong and had a large impact on the pace we could develop new applications and still keep a coherent ui.',

      'I was trusted with more and more responsibilities at Thomas Cook and when a colleague and me started to discuss the potential of setting up a GraphQL API for the web we got an ok to test it out on a small application. The reason to try it was that we had seen that there was much time going in to writing API:s for similar API:s again and again across the company e.g. text data from our CMS and facts for hotels. We also had a need to figure out how to handle caching for our API:s to make our API calls run faster when possible.',
