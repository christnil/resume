  'I am the kind of person who really loves my job. I spend a lot of my free time programming applications and puzzles just for fun as well as reading blogs. A part from my job I like to spend time with my family, my girlfriend who is a recently graduated teacher and our 3-year-old son. I also follow a lot of sports for example golf, which I also (try to) play myself, hockey and some football.',
  'My first contact with Spotify was during my first year at KTH. It was presented in one of my classes and all of us where given codes to join. I didn\'t think much about it at the time since paying a subscription was not something I even considered doing as a student. But I think I have used it since then, first with commercials in between songs, then when I started working I could also afford to pay for the service and now we have a family subscription. The thought of cancelling our subscription has never even come up.',
  'Professionally I have also been influenced by Spotify\'s way of work. We have tried to copy some of the ideas that we read about in blogs. For example I have been involved in creating the concept of a guild at my two latest clients. Probably not in the exact same way but something similar. It has been a great way to create contact surfaces between teams. At Thomas Cook we had one of our Netlight colleagues at Spotify join us for a lunch to present how A/B testing was used at Spotify and it was very appreciated at the client. At my current client I’m trying to figure out if backstage is something we can set up to increase our productivity when setting up new micro services.',
  'To summarize, Spotify has always been a place where I can see myself working and enjoying my work. I like the product as well as what I read and hear about Spotify\'s way of work. When looking at this specific role. I think it is a good fit to what I have worked with previously and a tech stack that I like to work with. I also enjoy working full stack when it is possible since I think it is the most effective way of working for me.',

export const professional = 'It is important to me to have a good relationship with the people I work with. I like to collaborate daily with my colleagues and value team effort more than what I do myself. In teams where I have worked for longer time periods, I have ended up in a role where I handle much of the communication with stakeholders, architects and users. It is something I like since I value having a bigger picture of how my team fits in with the organization.';

export const favoriteProject = 'The project that I am most proud of having been a part of is the one at Thomas Cook. I worked in a very inspiring team and was trusted with a lot of responsibility even though I was the only consultant on the team. The journey we made, from a monolithic .Net application to more of a “microservice” architecture with modern tech stack and continuous delivery, has shown me what is possible to achieve if you set your mind to it.';
