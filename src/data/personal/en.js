A part from my job I like to spend time with my family, my girlfriend who is a recently graduated teacher and our 3 year old son. I also follow a lot of sports for example golf, which I also (try to) play myself, hockey and some football.';

I worked in a very inspiring team and was trusted with a lot of responsibility even though I was the only consultant on the team. The journey we did, from a monolithic .Net application to more of a "microservice" architecture with modern tech stack and continuous delivery, has shown me what is possible to achieve if you set your mind to it.';
